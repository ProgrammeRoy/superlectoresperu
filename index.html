                    Hello! Dear friend we give you the most cordial welcome, knowing in advance that if you have reached this page, it is not by chance or pure coincidence because of the multiple experiences and testimonies of many children and adolescents that make up our reading family, we assure you that there is a very, very special purpose for which at this precise moment you find yourself reading these lines.
